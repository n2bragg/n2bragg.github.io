<p>Here we see an example with name confusion.  This is the same problem when a single street has two or more names, and multiple streets in the same city have identical names.
This page numbering scheme will only cause confusion.</p>

<p>Let's take a moment to imagine a phone call between a customer and technical support:</p>
<br>Tech: Please open the manual to page number one.
<br>Customer: OK, I'm there. 
<br>Tech: Here you will see a list of the supplied accessories, the first two items are the battery and battery charger.
<br>Customer: Wait, I don't see the accessories.
<br>Tech: Turn to page one please.
<br>Customer: I am on page one.
<br>Tech: Here you will see a list of the supplied accessories, the first two items are the battery and battery charger.
<br>Customer: I don't see the accessories!  I see a picture of the camera.
<br>Tech: Are you looking at the manual?
<br>Customer: Yes, I found a .pdf file on google.
<br>Tech: Are you looking at the page numbers in the lower right hand corner?
<br>Customer: No, mine are at the top.
<br>Tech: OK, look in the lower right hand corner please.
<br>Customer: There aren't any page numbers.
<br>Tech: Scroll down.
<br>Customer: OK, now I see we are on page. 17
<br>Tech: OK, great, you see the accessories listed...

<p>This is obviously frustrating for the user and costly to the manufacturer.</p>


<p>The solution is very simple.  Recognize that users may interact with your product multiple ways, and put yourself in their shoes.  In this case giving each page a single undisputed page number makes life easier for everyone.</p>
